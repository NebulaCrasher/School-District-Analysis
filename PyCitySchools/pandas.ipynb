    "After consolidation of the school data set and student data set, there are a few observations to be made. The following observations can be made; school type and school size are two key factors in the overall passing percentage of students. School type refers to whether or not a school is considered a Charter or a District school. According to the data, **charter schools are more likely to have a higher overall percentage of students that are passing both math and reading**. Data shows that charter schools have 90.43% of their student population passing both math and reading whereas district schools only have 53.67% of their student population passing both subjects. \n",
    "\n",
    "This leads into the next observation, where by looking at whether or not a school is considered a District or Charter school one can also reliably guess at the size of the school. District schools tend to be bigger than charter schools, in fact comparing the smallest district schools vs smallest charter schools one can see that the smallest district school only consists of 427 students whereas the smallest district school consists of over 2000 students. **These sizes directly correlate with overall passing rate as there is an immediate decline from 90.58% of the highest populated charter (2283) to the lowest populated district school (2739) with a overall passing rate of 54.29%**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Moving forward, the school district may want to incentivize the distribution of school populations. Of course, there will be logistic difficulties regarding distance to schools and the school facility size itself among other things. However, we as a district should find a way to rebalance how many students are allocated to each school as a way to bolster passing rates and provide the best education to our students and their families. \n",
